# Understanding DUI Charges in California

Driving under the influence (DUI) charges in California are serious offenses with potentially life-altering consequences. This guide explains what you need to know if you're facing DUI charges in California.

## What Constitutes a DUI in California?

In California, you can be charged with a DUI for:

- Driving with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08% or higher
- Driving while under the influence of any drug (legal or illegal)
- Driving with a BAC of 0.01% or higher if you're under 21
- Driving with a BAC of 0.04% or higher if you're driving commercial vehicles

## Penalties for DUI Convictions

### First Offense
- Fines: $390 to $1,000 plus penalty assessments
- License suspension: 6 months
- Possible jail time: 48 hours to 6 months
- Mandatory DUI school: 3 months

### Repeat Offenses
Penalties increase significantly with each subsequent offense within 10 years.

## Common Defense Strategies

Several defense strategies may be applicable in your case:

1. **Challenging the traffic stop**: Was there reasonable suspicion?
2. **Testing procedures**: Were breathalyzer or blood tests properly administered?
3. **Rising BAC defense**: Your BAC may have been below the limit while driving but rose afterward

## What To Do If Charged

If you've been charged with a DUI:

1. Don't make statements to police without an attorney present
2. Document everything you remember about the arrest
3. Contact an experienced DUI attorney immediately
